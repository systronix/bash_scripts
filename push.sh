echo Try to do various git pushes
echo you must already have made local commits! This just does the push. 
echo do this already in each folder in which there are changes to push:
echo git add -A
echo git commit -m "Commit comment which explains what's different"
echo First: repos which are not libraries
# Don't use this script. Pushing is too complex to do this way.
